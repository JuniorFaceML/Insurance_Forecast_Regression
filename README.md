# Insurance_Forecast

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to conduct an analysis and build a regression model to predict medical expenses. An analysis of the available data has been performed, but unfortunately, there are not enough features for a more robust model, resulting in low metrics. However, the results are still slightly better than those of other respondents.
